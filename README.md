### Split
Can you select out only specific commits to put into a new stacked PR?

- Yes. When splitting, you can specify which branches to split the commits into. Just specify the existing branch to keep those commits in the original PR.

What happens if you split all of the commits into different branches?

- It seems like it will create new branches with the corresponding commits and the original branch will still retain all of the original commits as well.
